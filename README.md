# Fake News Detection using machine learning algorithms
Fake news on different platforms is spreading widely and is a matter of serious concern, as it causes social wars and permanent breakages of the bonds established among people. A lot of research is already going on focused on the classification of fake news. The dataset used is imported from Kaggle with a numerous amount of data. Hence classifying data to aware people and keep them out of ill information is necessary and need of the day. 

Here, we have implemented two famous classification algorithm to assign data and fake and real according to the input provided by the dataset. Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes is incorporated. 

Computer cannot understand textual data hence a suitable way need to be found to convert the text into meaningful numbers. After this data is split into training and test data. Trained model is found using the training data and then new data is feed into the model and then it is predicted whether the data is real or fake. 

The dataset is imported from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv
